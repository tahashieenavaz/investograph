# Investograph

This research compares the subway networks of Paris, London, and São Paulo, aiming to assess eciency and guide strategic investments. Advanced network analysis techniques are employed to evaluate centrality measures, connectivity patterns, and network robustness. The ndings identify key areas for targeted investments to enhance overall transit network performance, offering valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and investors.

## Dataset

To explore data, a common format that represents the relevant information, should be established. The following depicts
the data repositories:
- Paris: The dataset, a text-formatted le, consists of **933** edges and **376** vertices. Each vertex is associated with a unique ID, and similarly, each edge is assigned an ID. The le provides detailed information about how edges connect. This structure enables precise analysis of the relationships within the dataset.
- São Paulo: The dataset is in CSV format, detailing stations and their neighbors. The graph comprises **79** vertices.
- London: The dataset is organized into separate les: one dedicated to nodes and another comprehensive le that encapsulates edges. This intricate network consists of **503** edges interconnecting **369** nodes.
